1. CONTROLLED INPUTS:
A control input in a form element like a text field or select box whose value
is managed by react state
USES:
- real time validation(ex: password strength)
- auto-formatting input(ex: automatically adding dashes in a phone number)
- keeping data even if input disappears

2. UNCONTROLLED INPUTS: form elements where react doesnt manage input's state.
Instead, DOM handles the data, just as in plain html.

Instead of using useState to track the value, we use ref to access the value
only when you need it, like when the form is submitted.
